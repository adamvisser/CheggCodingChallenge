# Chegg Coding Challenge

##Purpose of this Repo

The purpose of this repo is to act as documentation as I go through the needed process so that I can talk to somebody at Chegg about an oppurtunity which I would like to pursue through them. This repo should work well to show that I was properly following the specifications of the Challenge itself. 

##Challenge Specifications

I only have 3 hours and I started at 10:45 AM on Saturday July 16 20016.
